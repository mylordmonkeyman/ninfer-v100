# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next artifact contract

This reference defines the NInfer artifact built for the single-RTX-PRO-6000 Flash-Next target.
Generic framing, numeric semantics, and physical layouts are defined by
[`artifact-container.md`](artifact-container.md), [`tensor-formats.md`](tensor-formats.md), and
[`storage-layouts.md`](storage-layouts.md). Model mathematics are defined by
[`qwen3.8-flash-next-model.md`](qwen3.8-flash-next-model.md).

## Identity and provenance

```text
filename   = qwen3_8_flash_next_mixed.ninfer
model_id   = qwen3.8-flash-next
weights_id = mixed-nvfp4-fp8-ple-int4
target_key = qwen3_8_flash_next
recipe_id  = qwen3_8_flash_next_mixed-v1
```

The converter consumes only these pinned sources:

- `primitive-ai/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-mixed-NVFP4-FP8` at
  `a4e813ed3cfbbcc61e2929699eccb864a4dfa843`, excluding its BF16 PLE table;
- `primitive-ai/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-PLE-quant` at
  `da8b39586016d8325ac619be28ad77d6296625ec`, using only `ples_int4`;
- the six frontend resources verified byte-identical to the official repository;
- the official Qwen Community License Agreement 1.0, retained beside the local artifact.

This is a converter splice, not a Transformers-loadable checkpoint directory. It replaces exactly
128 BF16 PLE tensors and consumes all other 296502 source tensors assigned by the recipe.
The released artifact described below stores MTP expert banks as BF16. Its SHA256 and inspected
inventory are recorded in the [release manifest](../../model-cards/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-mixed-NInfer/artifact-manifest.json).
The historical conversion report did not record a converter Git revision; the release's compatible
engine revision must not be interpreted as that missing provenance.

## Closed object inventory

The artifact contains 1566 objects: six raw frontend resources and 1560 tensors.

| Format | Layout | Objects | Placement with all features |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `BF16` | `contiguous-le-v1` | 1237 | Device, except two host-mapped MTP expert banks |
| `FP8_E4M3FN_ROW_F32S` | `row-scale-f32-v1` | 96 | Device |
| `NVFP4` | `expert-blockscale-k16-m128x4-v1` | 96 | Device |
| `I64` | `contiguous-le-v1` | 3 | mapped host metadata |
| `U4Z8G16_F16S` | `packed-u4-g16-v1` | 128 | mapped host PLE |
| resource | `raw-bytes-v1` | 6 | retained host bytes |

With Text, MTP, and Vision enabled and default BF16 token embedding/output head, the exact binder
consumes every object and plans 1427 device objects, 133 mapped tensors, and six host resources.
Device-bound artifact tensor payload is 76251938528 bytes (71.02 GiB), excluding padding and the
1415581696-byte NVFP4 MTP device buffers created by the loader. These figures exclude runtime
workspaces, graphs, recurrent state and KV caches; they are not total VRAM requirements. The mapped
PLE plus indexing metadata occupies 32000162072 bytes (29.80 GiB). The complete released file is
113298397952 bytes (105.52 GiB); it is intentionally not all-resident in VRAM.

MTP and Vision objects remain mandatory artifact members. Disabling either feature validates its
descriptors without materializing them; it does not define another artifact identity.

## Text storage boundary

Every one of 48 layers stores four BF16 tensors for the attention hyper-connection, five BF16
router/shared-expert tensors, two expert-major banks, four BF16 tensors for the MoE
hyper-connection, and seven attention- or GDN-specific tensors.

The two expert banks per layer are:

```text
text/layers/{l}/mlp/experts/gate_up [512,1280,2560] NVFP4
text/layers/{l}/mlp/experts/down    [512,2560,640]  NVFP4
```

Each expert owns packed E2M1 codes, K16 E4M3FN block scales swizzled for the Blackwell
`M128x4` consumer, and one FP32 weight-scale divisor. The gate/up rows are `[gate_640,up_640]`.

Full-attention layers store FP8 projections:

```text
attention/query_gate_key_value [13312,2560]
attention/output               [2560,6144]
```

Within each of 24 query heads the first parent preserves `[query_256,output_gate_256]`, followed by
512 key rows and 512 value rows. Each E4M3FN row owns one FP32 multiplier.

GDN layers store FP8 `[q,k,v,z] [16384,2560]` and output `[2560,6144]` parents. BF16 tails store the
four-tap convolution, `[A,B] [96,2560]`, `A_log`, `dt_bias`, and gated norm.

The global BF16 token embedding and output head are independent `[248320,2560]` objects. The final
hyper mixer is three BF16 tensors.

## PLE mapped layout

PLE support weights at `text/layers/1/ple/` remain device BF16. Its three exact int64 metadata
tensors and 128 packed table shards remain file-mapped for the lifetime of the loaded model.

Each shard is `[2500012,160]`. For a row, 80 low-nibble-first U4Z8 bytes are read from the shard's
code plane and ten FP16 group multipliers are read from its separately aligned scale plane. A value
is `(code - 8) * scale`. Runtime gathers only the 16 rows selected for a token; artifact
materialization must not copy the complete PLE table into VRAM. After device materialization, the
loader explicitly warms the mapped PLE code and scale pages before marking the model ready. The
table then uses host RAM page cache; host-memory pressure can evict pages and affect latency.

## MTP, Vision, and frontend

The released artifact has 29 BF16 MTP objects, including dense `[512,...]` expert banks and one
full-attention QSA layer. When MTP is enabled, the binder retains the two BF16 expert banks on the
host and the loader quantizes them into NVFP4 device banks before execution. This changes runtime
storage, not the published artifact bytes. The binder also accepts the optional artifact produced
by `tools/convert/qwen3_8_flash_next/splice_mtp.py`, whose two MTP expert banks are already NVFP4;
that artifact has 1235 BF16 and 98 NVFP4 objects and is not the production artifact released here.
The current converter inventory describes that pre-spliced layout, so it must not be used as an
inventory report for the original released file.
Vision has 333 BF16 objects covering the patch stem, 27 blocks, and merger. The six retained
resources are tokenizer JSON, tokenizer configuration, chat template, generation configuration,
image preprocessor configuration, and video preprocessor configuration.

The active binder lives under `src/targets/qwen3_8_flash_next`; it checks every name, shape, format,
layout, and placement and fails if any artifact directory object is missing, extra, or consumed
twice. The registered Flash-Next Program executes this contract through the public Engine.
