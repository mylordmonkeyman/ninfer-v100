# Perplexity evaluation

`ninfer-perplexity` measures the causal perplexity produced by a registered `.ninfer` artifact.
It uses the artifact's tokenizer, Text model, selected Main KV representation, final normalization,
and main output head. It is an offline evaluator, not a serving endpoint or a logits-export API.

## Run the fixed corpus

The repository includes `ninfer-ppl-1m-v1`, a fixed set of 16 independent UTF-8 streams covering
English reference text, English long-form text, Chinese reference text, and NInfer C++/CUDA code.
`full` selects all streams; `--quick` selects one stream from each domain.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --corpus eval/corpora/perplexity-1m/manifest.json \
  --quick \
  --kv-dtype fp8
```

The default evaluation uses a 4,096-token context and a 2,048-token stride. Use `--context` and
`--stride` to change that protocol, or score one UTF-8 file with `--text FILE`. The available Main
KV representations are `bf16`, `int8`, `fp8`, `nvfp4`, and `k8v4`. Reports retain the exact
selected external name in `execution.kv_dtype`.

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --text notes.txt \
  --context 16384 --stride 8192 \
  --kv-dtype int8
```

Run `./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity --help` for the complete command surface. The evaluator loads
the model once, verifies and tokenizes every selected stream before scoring, and writes structured
startup plus closed preflight/scoring/stream phase records to stderr. Long scoring emits throttled
progress between its begin and terminal records. Interactive weight loading uses the same transient
progress line as the other applications. The final domain/overall table remains product output on
stdout; the independent machine report is `report.json` under `profiles/perplexity/` unless
`--output` supplies an empty directory.

The fixed 64K comparison protocol uses the same registered artifact and full corpus for every
mode with `--context 65536 --stride 32768`; `--quick` is not part of that acceptance run.

## Metric

For a stream `x[0..N)`, every token after `x[0]` is scored exactly once. A window `[b,e)` with target
suffix `[s,e)` contributes:

```text
log p(x[i] | x[b], ..., x[i-1])  for i in [s,e)
```

Each window starts from empty State and Main KV, so history before `b` is deliberately excluded.
The reported metric is therefore fixed-window, truncated-context causal perplexity:

```text
mean_nll = -sum(logprob) / scored_tokens
perplexity = exp(mean_nll)
```

The first window scores `[1,min(context,N))`. Each later window advances by `stride` targets while
retaining up to `context-stride` preceding tokens as local context. Streams never share history.

## Comparing runs

For a numerical comparison, keep the corpus bytes and stream order, tokenizer output, context,
stride, Prefill chunk, score tile, and all execution settings fixed except the variable being
measured. Compare KV formats with the same artifact. Compare weight formats with the same KV format
and first confirm that both artifacts tokenize every stream identically.

The corpus name is a workload scale, not an exact token count. Exact input and scored-token counts
are runtime results from the current artifact tokenizer and are recorded in each report. Reports
contain unrounded NLL/PPL values for every window, stream, domain, and the token-weighted overall
aggregate.

Verify the fixed corpus without loading a model:

```bash
python3 tools/perplexity/prepare_corpus.py --check
```
